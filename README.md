## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Does this increase FPS automatically?**  
A: Not directly. It reduces latency, bloat, and improves responsiveness — which may *feel* smoother and can result in small FPS gains in some titles.

**Q: Is this safe?**  
A: It’s a modded version of Nvidia's official driver. Use at your own discretion. Always back up your current config or driver.

**Q: Will this work on laptops?**  
A: Yes, but some laptop-specific features (like Optimus) may behave differently. Test at your own risk.
